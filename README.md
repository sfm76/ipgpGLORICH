# ipgpGLORICH
A data visualization dashboard exploring the GLORICH (Global River Chemistry) database. Focus: understanding sources of fluxes in bicarbonate ion (HCO3). 
Bicarbonate ion serves as a proxy of carbon influx into our water sources. We can use HCO3 to understand to what extent different tributaries serve as carbon sinks. 

Research question: Why do some rivers absorb more bicarbonate ion than others? How can we understand fluxes in bicarbonate ion in the water cycle?
This work was cultivated throughout an internship with the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris.

Dashboard includes plots showing the general distribution of the GLORICH data to understand the limitations of our conclusions. 
Given the lack of continuous data in Africa, we are unable to make meaningful conclusions about bicarbonate as a whole and must specify our conclusions to certain regions.

The dashboard also shows the distribution of just the bicarbonate ion data. 

The areas of exploration were the lithology of the soil around the tributary, which might change the behavior in the carbon uptake of the water. 
I also explored the climate in certain regions to understand the atmospheric impact on carbon sequestration.
